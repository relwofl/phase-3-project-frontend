# Cow Tracker 
The Cow tracker was created to help me keep track of the cows on my parents farm. Cows come and go, making it difficult to remeber Cows from the past. In Cow Tracker Lite, Cows can be created and assigned to a farm field. Cows can also also be assigned a mother to help keep better track of the herd.
